 Object Oriented Programming is creating classes and objects
 
 
 class : a template / format for creating objects
 object :  instance of a class
 
 
 vehicle as a class
 objects of vehicle class : car,cycle,bike, truck, bus, train
 
 
 Fruits as a class
 object of Fruits class : kiwi, berries, apple, pomogranate, sapota, grape.... 
 
 
 HumanBeings as a class
 objects of HumanBeings : Male, Female, Trans.... 
 
 
 creation of object for a class
 
 
 class Fruit
 {
 
 Fruit kiwi = new Fruit();
 Fruit Apple = new Fruit();
 
 }
 
 
 
 class attributes :   class properties are class attributes .
 
 static attributes :  these attributes are common for all objects of class. we don't need object to access these. we can access with the class name
 instance attributes :  these attributes are not common for all objects of class, in stead they differ from one object to other . 
                       we need object to access these. 
 
 class methods :   actions which are performed by the objects of a class. 
 
 
 static methods : these methods/actions are common for all objects of class. we don't need object to access these. we can access with the class name
 instance methods :  these methods/actions are not common for all objects of class, n stead they differ from one object to other
                     we need object to access these. 
                     
                     
Constructor :  it is a special method which is executed at the time of object creation

name of the constructor should be same as the name of class.  




Encapsulation : it is a mechanism of wrapping the vaiables and methods in single unit.  some variables of a class can be hidden from another classes. 
                this will help us in hiding the sensitive data and acheive security. 
                
                
                
Inheritence ::   it is for reusability . thru inheritance we can resuse certain methods and variables/attributes belonging to one class into an another class


Key word : extends

Sub Class (child class) :   which inherits/extends and another class   ex : Child inherits Parent

Super class (parent class) :  the class which is being inherited ex : Parent is inherited by child. 
 
 
 
 class Parent
 {
 }
 
 
 class Child extends Parent 
 {
 }
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Polymorphism :  one things appearing in many forms.   
 
 
 
 Method Overloading :   same method appearing multiple times with multiple sugnatures in the same class   
 
 
 class Overloading
 {
 
 int add(int a, int b)
 {
 }
 
 
 float add(float a, float b)
 {
 }
 
 }  
 
 
 
 Method Overriding :   same method appearing multiple times with same signatures in the parent and child class
  
  
  
 
 Abstraction : is the process of hiding ceertain details and only showing the necessary information
 
 key word : abstract
 
 Abstract Methods :   it is a normal java method without a method body.       
 Abstract Classes :    it is a normal java class with a minimum of one abstract method 
 
 Interfaces :    interface contain only abstract classess and no concrete classes.
