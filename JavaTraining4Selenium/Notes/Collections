Limitations od arrays:
======================

Arrays can only store homogeneous data type
Arrays do not have any ready method support
Arrays are not dynamic
Array are not built on any standard data structures.



Collection :   when we want to represent a group of heterogeneous types in a single enity the we can choose collections.


collection is a framework in java. it has multiple interfaces and classes. 



"collection"  is parent interface.


1) List (I) :   it is a child interface of collection.  in list duplicates are allowed and order of insertion is preserved.

A) Array List(c) : implementation class of List Interface. it is used when we want to retrive data with high frequency.  
B) Linked List(c) :   implementation class of List Interface . it is used when we want to add/delete/modify data with high frequency.



2) Set (I) :  it is a child interface of collection. in list duplicates are not allowed and order of insertion is not preserved.

A) HashSet :  implementation class of set Interface. order of insertion is not preserved


B) LinkedHashSet : implementation class of set Interface. order of insertion is preserved

3) Queue (I) :     it is a child interface of collection.   when we want some data to be stored prior to processing .  

A) Priority Queue(c) :
B) Blocking Queue(c) :
C) Priority Blocking Queue(c) :
D) Linked Blocking Queue(c) : 

4) Map(I) :     it is not a child interface of collection.  each entry in map is in the form of <Key,Value> pairs. 

    
A) Hash Map(c) :  order of insertion is not preserved.  duplicate keys are not allowed but duplicate values are allowed.  it is non synchronized.  
B) Hash Table(c) :  order of insertion is not preserved.  duplicate keys are not allowed but duplicate values are allowed.   it is synchronized. one after the other in accessing
