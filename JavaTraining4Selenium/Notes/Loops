 Loops in java are used to execute one statement / a particular block of code multiple time
 
 
 for :
 =====
 
 initalization :   setting up the value 
 conditon : we perform the check on a particular condition and will execute the loop body only if the condition is true
increment/decrement :  continuity of the loop


for(initalization;condition;increment/decrement)
{

body of the loop

}
 
 
 while :
 // entry controlled loop
 
 while(conditon)
 {
 // body of the loop
 }
 
 
 do.. while :
 
 
 // exit controlled loop
 
 
 do
 {
 // loop body;
 }while(condition);
 
 
 
 
 for each :   for each loop in java is used with arrays and collections
 
 
 for(<data type> <variable name>:<array name>)
 {
 }
