Conditional statements : based up a certain condition if we want to execute some block of code then we can go for conditional statements
in java


if :    if the condition is true then if block is executed.

int age = 22;

if(age >= 18)
{
System.out.println("yes, this person is eligible for voting");
}



if else :  here we can check for both true and false

int age = 22;

if(age >= 18)
{
System.out.println("yes, this person is eligible for voting");
}
else
{
System.out.println("no, this person is not eligible for voting");
}

else if ladder :  here we can check for multiple conditions at the same time.

int age = 22;

if(age >= 18 & age <60)
{
System.out.println("yes, this person is eligible for voting");
}
else if(age >= 60)
{
System.out.println("yes, this person is eligible for voting but he is a senior citizen");
}
else if(age <= 5)
{
System.out.println("no, this person is not eligible for voting and he is a kid");
}
else
{
System.out.println("no, this person is not eligible for voting");
}
