Selenium Webdriver Architecture :
==================================



client server model


client : ide(eclipse/note pad/) + machine 

server : browser driver (chrome driver, gekodriver{firefox},safari,opera,IE) 



1) as a programer/automation tester we write code and run it from client.
2)whole code is converted to JSON format
3) it is sent to server(browser driver)  thru a JSON wired protocol over internet
4) server(browser driver) receives the JSON and coverts it into executable instructions and passes to browser
5)browser receives the instructions and executes them. this is the automation execution
6) if there are errors the same process is repeated in reverse
